# iNEWS Gateway

The iNEWS Gateway communicates with an iNEWS system to ingest and remain in sync with a rundown. The rundowns will update in real time and any changes made will be seen from within your Rundown View. 

The setup for the iNEWS Gateway is already in the Docker Compose file you downloaded earlier. Remove the _\#_ symbols from the start of the section labelled `inews-gateway:` and make sure that other ingest gateway sections have a _\#_ prefix on each line.

Although the iNEWS Gateway is available free of charge, an iNEWS license is not. Visit [Avid's website](https://www.avid.com/products/inews/how-to-buy) to find an iNEWS reseller that handles your geographic area.
