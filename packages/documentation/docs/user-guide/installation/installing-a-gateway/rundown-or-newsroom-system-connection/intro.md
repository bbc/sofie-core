# Rundown & Newsroom Systems

NewsRoom Computer Systems (NRCS) are software suites that manage various parts of news production. Many of these systems support some sort of Rundown creation module that allows authoring live show Rundowns by organizing them into units and sub-units such as Pages, Items, Cues, etc.

Sofie&nbsp;Core doesn't talk directly to the newsroom systems, but instead via one of the Ingest Gateways. The purpose of these Gateways is to act as adapters for the various protocols used by these systems, while keeping as much fidelity as possible in the incoming data.

Some of the currently available options in the Sofie ecosystem include Google Docs Spreadsheet Gateway, iNEWS Gateway, and the MOS Gateway which can handle interacting with any system that communicates via MOS \([Media Object Server Communications Protocol](http://mosprotocol.com/)\).

[Rundown Editor](../../rundown-editor.md) is a special case of an Ingest Gateway that acts as a simple Rundown Editor itself.
